# SC2002 Assignment – HDB BTO System

## Introduction

This project is part of a simulation of the **Build-To-Order (BTO)** public housing system in Singapore. It models the real-world processes managed by the Housing & Development Board (HDB), allowing different users—**Applicants**, **HDB Officers**, and **HDB Managers**—to interact with the system based on role-based permissions. The system supports project creation, flat applications, officer registration, and communication through enquiries.

It was developed using **Object-Oriented Design and Programming (OODP)** principles, and emphasizes concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and SOLID design.
